# AirMouse
A touchless input device built on the top of the physical mouse idiom using the Leap Motion Controller.
AirMouse is the result of my work for the Human Computer Interaction course (University of Florence - Prof. A. D. Bagdanov)

*In this project I studied how to emulate the behavior of a physical mouse using the 3D hand model generated by the Leap Motion device. I used machine learning techniques for recognizing the ”mouse grab” pose and a small set of mouse gestures. 
The main idea is to simulate the mouse behavior without touching any physical object but using the same idiom learned using a computer. 
AirMouse was evaluated with a usability test to assess user opinions and by a set of timed tests to collect an objective measure of the performance and an estimation of the learning curve.*
